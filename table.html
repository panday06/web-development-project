<td>1</td>
<td>Articulated Robots</td>
<td>Articulated robots are highly flexible robots made up of numerous rotary joints. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>SCARA robots</td>
<td>A SCARA robot is a Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm. This acronym refers to its limited flexibility whereby it can move along the X and Y axes but is rigid in the Z-axis.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>Delta Robot</td>
<td>A delta robot consists of 3 parallel robotic arms mounted on a stationary base. The robotic arms have both prismatic and rotary joints and are powered by 3 motors fitted inside the base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>Cartesian Robot</td>
<td>Cartesian robots take up a cubical work envelope. They are assembled on-site and can be customized to fit particular applications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5</td>
<td>Polar robots</td>
<td>A polar robot is made up of 4 main parts; a rotary base, an elevation pivot, an arm that can expand and retract like a telescope, and a retraction boom. It is used for simple tasks as it can not only extend to the area around the base of the robot. It can move along the XYZ axes but the points that the robot arm can reach are determined by how far it can stretch from the robot base.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6</td>
<td>Cylindrical Robot</td>
<td>The structure of a cylindrical robot is made up of a rotating shaft mounted on a base using a rotary joint. The rotating shaft is further perpendicularly connected to a robot arm that can expand, retract, and move vertically along the rotating shaft.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>7</td>
<td>Collabrative Robots</td>
<td>By definition, collaborative robots are robots designed to be more human-friendly both in terms of safety and operation. As such collaborative robots are not necessarily defined by how many axes they have but rather how well they can co-work with human beings. </td>
