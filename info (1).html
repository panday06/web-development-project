 <h3><p>
Robots will soon be everywhere. How can we nurture them to be our friends and useful collaborators? Robots with good aesthetic design, rich personalities, and social cognitive intelligence can potentially connect deeply and meaningfully with humans.</h3></p>

<h2>Robots for AI Platforms</h2>
<h3>Robots will serve as AI platforms for research, education, medical and healthcare, sales and service, and entertainment applications, and will evolve to become benevolent, super-intelligent living machines who advance civilization and achieve ever-greater good for all.
Creating value with
human-like robots.Endowed with rich personality and holistic cognitive AI, our robots are able to engage emotionally and deeply with people.  They can maintain eye contact, recognize faces, understand speech, hold natural conversations, and learn and develop through experience.</h3></p>
<h3><p>“On the tree of robotic life, human-like robots play a particularly valuable role. It makes sense. Humans are brilliant, beautiful, compassionate, loveable, and capable of love, so why shouldn’t we aspire to make robots human-like in these ways? Don’t we want robots to have such marvelous capabilities as love, compassion, and genius?”</h3></p>

 <h2>Humanizing AI</h2>

<h3><p>When people encounter our Hanson Robots, like Sophia, they tend to show deep engagement and report a warm, unforgettable emotional connection.Given the positive reaction people have when interacting with Sophia and other Hanson robots, we believe that human-like robots can be the gold standard for human-AI interface design.</p></h3>
